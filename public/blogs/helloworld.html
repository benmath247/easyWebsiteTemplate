    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <p>My name is Jennifer Jaroslavsky and I am an Operations/Project/People Manager leading institutional change and
        growth
        one (or many simultaneous) initiative(s) at a time. I’ve recently departed from my previous organization due to
        restructuring needs and have subsequently created this website to initiate my new job search and outline my
        capabilities as a teammate and employee to my potential employers.</p>
    <p>The story all begins with the Boston University Dean of Students Office in the summer of 2012. Throughout 8 years
        at
        this institution, I evolved from student employee to student manager to administrative manager under the
        guidance of
        the Chief of Staff and Director of Operations. His trust and leadership allowed me to grow into the manager I am
        today, leaving the building of his student employment program in my (and my co-manager’s) hands. Throughout my 4
        years as Administrative Manager, we created, implemented, and facilitated a world-class employment program for
        around 300 students focused on providing training and opportunities in customer service, professional
        development,
        mentorship, and project management. At this point in my life, I was continuing to pursue a professional opera
        career
        that led as the forefront of my priorities and took me to New York City.</p>
    <p>In NYC, I continued my administrative career as an assistant to the Dean of Development and Alumni Relations at
        NYU
        Law. The Dean and his team enhanced my skills introducing advanced project management resources and efforts into
        my
        toolbelt. This paved the way for my next opportunity at the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation.</p>
    <p>Initiating my time there as Executive Assistant to the Co-Founder &amp; CSO allowed me to build a strong rapport
        with
        the Alzheimer’s community that he so thoughtfully guided and understand the needs of the patient and caretaker
        population while managing his medical practice. Following our Chief of Staff’s temporary departure on parental
        leave
        and given the effective change and growth I brought to the ADDF over my first year, I was granted the
        opportunity to
        temporarily step into a portion of her role. This included serving as a strategic partner to the CEO and leading
        his
        mission through creation of an internship program, overseeing an office renovation, coordinating board and
        committee
        meetings, and guiding the Employee Wellness &amp; Engagement Task Force. Subsequently, the ADDF acknowledged my
        contributions and capabilities with a promotion to Senior Manager, Scientific Operations. In this most recent
        chapter, I started off my new responsibilities with managing a multi-million-dollar, multi-site biomarker-based
        clinical trial and successfully bringing it to approval by the organization’s advisory board. In addition this
        work,
        I created and implemented various operational and project management tools and processes, facilitated the ADDF’s
        conference strategy including building relationships with external stakeholders to accomplish thought leadership
        initiatives, and trained multiple members of the Science team.</p>
    <p>All of this work has led to this moment where I launch in search of my next opportunity. What that is, you’ll
        have to
        stay tuned to find out…</p>
