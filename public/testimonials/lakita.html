<p>I had the pleasure of working alongside Jennifer and observing her at Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation for 2
    years on several projects. During this time, Jennifer consistently impressed me with her skills as a project and
    operations manager.</p>
<p>Here are some of Jennifer's strengths:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Strong Organizational Skills:</strong> Jennifer is extremely adept at keeping projects on track and
        ensuring goals for the project are met. She would ensure that each person understood his or her responsibilities
        and tasks with respect to meeting the goals of the project. She would make sure that I knew my upcoming tasks
        related to our speech consortium project and would ensure that I met deadlines for the project. She communicated
        with and acted as a liaison between our organization and external partners for the speech consortium. She
        effectively managed the bi-weekly meetings with our investment committee by scheduling and organizing the zoom
        meetings, communicating with the committee members (most of which are external), writing and disseminating the
        meeting minutes, and disseminating the meeting materials to the committee members prior the meetings. I never
        had to worry about anything regarding the meeting other than making my presentation to the committee. Jennifer
        made sure that these meetings ran smoothly each time.

        <strong>Excellent Communication Skills:</strong> Jennifer is an excellent communicator who can effectively relay
        information to both internal and external stakeholders. She is also a great listener and actively solicits
        feedback from team members to ensure that the job is performed accurately.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Jennifer is a resourceful individual who can think quickly and find
        creative solutions to challenges. She is skilled at creating documents and spreadsheets that can help manage
        projects. She is able to recognize the needs of the team and devise a solution to address problems that arise.
        Many times she has approached me about developing a management tool to help keep me on task with my many
        projects. She has a wide range of administrative and operational skills.

        <strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Jennifer fosters a collaborative and positive work environment. She is skilled
        at keeping team members on task and works across multiple teams to ensure all team members understand their
        roles on a particular project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adaptability and Flexibility:</strong> Jennifer has exhibited the ability to adapt and be flexible,
        taking on several roles within the organization during her tenure. During her time as one of my colleagues, she
        has served as an executive assistant, project manager, operations manager, interim chief of staff, event
        planner, and support for the scientific team members. She was always ready to step in and fill any role that
        needed filling.

<p>Jennifer Jaroslavsky is a highly skilled and dedicated project manager who would be a valuable asset to any team. I
    highly recommend her for any project/operations management or leadership role.</p>
